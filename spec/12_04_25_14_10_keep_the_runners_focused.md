Keep the runners focused

In our first user interview, we had her use the peacemaker runner. Whose personality is to help people send kinder messages by rewriting potential messages to kinder versions. Our user sometimes tried to vent to this AI and sometimes it would interpret her venting as an angry message that it needed to rewrite.

Our decision on how to solve this is to make runners only have one personality. All runners are couriers and their base desire is to ferry messages from one human to other another human. In addition to this they all have personalities which define when and how they rewrite the messages they receive. We should make this behavior explicit to the user. 

For example, peacemaker in additon to his desire to send messages to another human, wants to rewrite those messages to be nice. He does help users vent. If users want to vent they should call another runner who they can vent to, and it can listen and then compile and send a summary of the venting to the human or another human. This fits with our original spec, and also prevents the human from being disappointed by the mistakes computer systems inevitably make. Mistakes which a human would not make. 

If the human expects it is talking to another human and then the system makes a mistake which another human would not make, they feel deceived, rightfully so. But if the runner makes it clear by its greeting and actions that it is a runner and not a human, then the human will not be disappointed. 

We are building runners, which are a kind of messenger. They are not humans and likely will never be. But they are a very valuable part of the ecosystem.
