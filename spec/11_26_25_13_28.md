# Phase 1.01 (Ruwt CLI)

The Previous breaks down our complete MVP into phases with phase one being the runner as a utility. Now we want to make the absolute bare minimum of phase one, the engine of the runner but without the UI. We will interact with this engine using a CLI.

## MVP

Takes a raw, angry text message as input.

Passes it to a "Runner" with a "Peacemaker" persona.

The Runner checks its memory (Did this user say they wanted to be kinder?).

The Runner refuses to send it and proposes a rewrite.

If the user wants the runner to rewrite it, they rewrite it

## Tech
Typescript 
ai-sdk/google

## Tests
* Identity Persistence: Does the Runner remember it is a "Peacemaker" even when I try to trick it?
* Context Awareness: Can it reject a message because it conflicts with a previous goal I stated? (e.g., "I want to be kind" $\to$ Runner blocks my angry text).
* The "Value" Rewrite: Is the rewritten message actually better?
