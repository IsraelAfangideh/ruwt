# Roadmap

The spec written yesterday, which encapsulates the full product, is too extensive to create at once. We will break it down into three versions which can be released one after the other and used by people.

## Phase One, the runner as a utility,

* Single Player mode

* One runner can analyze text and rewrite it for you

* Another can help you cope with different things

* Another can help with health care worries, another for marketing etc.

* And we have a visual builder where you can build your own runner and you can choose whether runners can talk to each other or not by dragging a path between them. Then if they can talk to each other they have access to each other's data.

* Runners also can compute the properties of the speaker and they have persistent memory

* Runners have a strong sense of its identity and role as mentioned in the previous spec, and will refuse requests if they do not align with their identity and role

* Runners love humans to the best of the runner's ability



## Phase Two: The Runner as a social lubricant between humans

* The runner can act as a courier

* The runner can prompt humans to connect if their message vectors tend to be very similar

* The runner can interpret and modify messages to suit the receiver's language or communication style.

* The runner can advise a human on whether sending a message is a good idea or not. And if a message deviates too much from a user's usual vector, the runner can check on the user, and advise them.

* The runner must love humans and must never betray humans by doing anything it does not believe the human explicitly wants.



## Phase 3: The human as a builder of community for other humans

* The human can build cities which other interested humans can join and can DM each other

* The human can build enclosed spaces where one to many communication is possible

* The builder of community becomes the *host* of the enclosed space or the *builder* of the city

* The host builder can grant authorities to other humans including picking host builders to succeed them

* There can only be one human host builder of a community
