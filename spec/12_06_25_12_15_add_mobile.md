Phase 1.01 was the CLI. We got cutomer feedback from this, and made the runners more focused and disciplined as a result. The first customer also wanted to use the product in the for factor of a mobile app and of mobile applications built using runners (Like a mediation app). So This spec is to add mobile capabilities to the protocol. 

Remember that in our protocol, privacy and property rights are the most important things. As well as the dignity of the human soul. And that the runners exist to preserve and protect these things at all costs. Even at risks to themselves. Therefore our mobile applications will not be applications in the traditional sense but will be runners. The runner will be the application. Each instance of the runner is a function, its inputs are humans and words, and its outputs are humans and words. Even in a so called application built in thr ruwt app, like the application for mediation, the runner will be called The Mediator. His instict is the same as all runners, to connect humans while respecting privacy and property. His personality is to help two people who are at odds understand the other person's point of view and be more reconciled to them than they currently are. He will allow one person to invite another person into a room. He will hear each of their complaints. He will listen to each person until the person feels understood, not until he thinks he understands. He will rewrite those complaints and present them to the other side. Then he will listen again as the people respond to this summary. He will do this again and again in a loop. Always trying to bring the two people together. He will on each response offer options to the humans including to terminate because they are reconciled or to terminate because they no longer want to continue the Mediation. He will attempt ONCE to convince the user who aims to terminate because they do not want to continue to in fact continue. He will continue his loop always seeking to get the humans to be reconciled even on points of view where there is subtle divergence. He is an extremist for reconciliation.

Despite the detailed description of The Mediator in this spec, the purpose of this spec is not to create him. 

Create a functional mobile version of the application, with the peacemaker runner hosted on it. It should look like a chat app, ad runners can be seen on the side bar, but they can also be called by simply using the @ symbol and seeng a list of runners. 

We should add the Peacemaker runner with the exact same instinct and personality as it currenly is in the CLI, making sure to respect [Link text](./12_04_25_14_10_keep_the_runners_focused.md)

We should move the CLI logic to a shared place where it can be imported and used by CLI and also by the mobile app.

Make deployment of the app to ios and android very simple to do. 

In short, the purpose of this spec is to give the customer their request when they used the CLI of adding mobile capabilities to the app.

When we finally do build The Mediator, he should let each person know about how long to wait for a response, or give a progress indicator of some sort. It will be different from Peacemaker, where either the human who is the destination of the message does not respond within the protocol.
